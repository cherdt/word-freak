Word Freak
==========

Just playing around. Generate Markov chains of order N. Keeps punctuation as part of words. It's fun but mostly nonsense.

Inspired by http://www.eblong.com/zarf/markov/, introduced to me by David Brandt when he used it to create random H-Dog articles.

Usage
-----

     wordfreq.py ch15-chowder 2

This will use order-2 Markov chains to produce a string from the source text, in this case, chapter 15 from Moby-Dick.
